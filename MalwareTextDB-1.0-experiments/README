==================================
Software Package for MalwareTextDB
==================================

This is a software package to replicate the ACL'17 paper titled:
           MalwareTextDB: A Database for Annotated Malware Articles

To run the code, you will require the specific versions of some Python
libraries that we used, as follows:
    appdirs==1.4.3
    numpy==1.12.1
    packaging==16.8
    pyparsing==2.2.0
    scikit-learn==0.18.1
    scipy==0.19.0
    six==1.10.0

To run Task 2, you will also need to install CRF++ and ensure it can be run
from command line (https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/)

This package already contains the results that we used in the paper, in the
corresponding "runlog" file in each TaskN folder (except for Task3, where it is
named "overall_scores").

Note that even with the same version of all the Python libraries, some results
might be different, due to the randomness in Liblinear, which is used in our
SVM experiments, which cannot be controlled from the Python package, as noted
here: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/365
