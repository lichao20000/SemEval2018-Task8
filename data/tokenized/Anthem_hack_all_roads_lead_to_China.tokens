This DT O

a DT O

This DT O
means VBZ O
that IN O
their PRP$ O

Unlike IN O
the DT O

As IN O

It PRP O
is VBZ O
not RB O

that IN O

All DT O
in IN O
all RB O

it PRP O
would MD O
seem VB O
that IN O
China NNP O
is VBZ O
pursuing VBG O
a DT O
uni�ed JJ O
approach NN O
to IN O
cyber VB O
operations NNS O

relying VBG O

as RB O

strategic JJ O

The DT O
Anthem NNP O

exposes VBZ O
the DT O
insidious JJ O
reality NN O
of IN O
modern JJ O
Chinese NNP O
cyber NNS O
espionage NN O
as IN O
it PRP O
continues VBZ O
its PRP$ O
unrelenting JJ O
strikes NNS O
at IN O
the DT O
soft JJ O
underbelly NN O
of IN O
the DT O
American JJ O
way NN O
of IN O

Moreover RB O
, , O
it PRP O
demonstrates VBZ O
the DT O
imposing VBG O
yet RB O
increasingly RB O
common JJ O
reality NN O
of IN O
conducting VBG O
threat NN O
intelligence NN O

without IN O
substantial JJ O

to TO O
start VB O
with IN O

Fortunately RB O
for IN O
us PRP O
, , O
we PRP O
were VBD O
able JJ O
to TO O
deduce VB O
informed VBN O
answers NNS O
to IN O
some DT O
of IN O
the DT O
outstanding JJ O
questions NNS O
to IN O
this DT O

by IN O
scrutinizing VBG O
our PRP$ O

that WDT O

ef�ciently RB O

In IN O
the DT O

of IN O
cyber JJ O

industry NN O
professionals NNS O
must MD O
learn VB O
to TO O
play VB O
the DT O
long JJ O

in IN O
order NN O
to TO O
generate VB O
a DT O
proactive JJ O
sense NN O

allowing VBG O

greater JJR O
ef�ciency NN O
and CC O

in IN O
mitigating VBG O
future JJ O

Additionally RB O
, , O
this DT O
incident NN O
underscores VBZ O
the DT O
frustrating JJ O
disparity NN O
of IN O
the DT O
industry NN O
when WRB O
it PRP O
comes VBZ O
to IN O
naming VBG O

With IN O
so RB O
many JJ O
threat NN O
actors NNS O
and CC O
indicators NNS O
�oating VBG O
around RB O
, , O
it PRP O
is VBZ O
can MD O
be VB O
frustrating JJ O
to TO O
keep VB O

of IN O
all PDT O
the DT O
disparate JJ O
pieces NNS O
of IN O
evidence NN O
, , O
especially RB O
when WRB O
countless JJ O
naming VBG O

are VBP O
applied VBN O

Without IN O
the DT O
use NN O

of IN O
the DT O

of IN O
incoming VBG O

, , O
this DT O
task NN O
would MD O
be VB O
extraordinarily RB O
time NN O
consuming VBG O
at IN O
best JJS O
and CC O
crippling VBG O
at RB O
worst JJS O

Moving VBG O
forward RB O
, , O
it PRP O
is VBZ O
important JJ O
to TO O
bear VB O
in IN O
mind NN O
that IN O
the DT O
adversary NN O
, , O
regardless RB O
of IN O

of IN O
origin NN O
, , O
shall MD O
almost RB O
certainly RB O
leverage VBP O
our PRP$ O
every DT O

against IN O

Even RB O
something NN O
as IN O
seemingly RB O
innocuous JJ O
as IN O
confusion NN O
over IN O

can MD O
easily RB O
consume VB O

creating VBG O
